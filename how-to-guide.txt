COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS:

0: edit.py
1: directory containing raw video clips and audio file
2: destination file name, including extension --> output will be placed in edit.py's root directory
3: tempo (in bpm) of the song this video will be set to
4: start time of the song file (in seconds) --> audio will start on the first beat of the measure before this second
5: a number greater than 1 speeds up every clip by that factor; "none" or a number less than 1 does nothing
6: "yes" or "true" adds 8 beats of black screen to the start/end; "no" or "false" does not
